# Vault Guard

![Vault Guard](frontend/static/frontend/logo.png)

Vault Guard is a secure open-source cloud-based password manager.

Passwords are encrypted and decrypted on the client-side using **AES** encryption algorithm.

Passwords are encrypted using the master password as the key.

To add a new password, or copy an stored password, the user must enter the master password for encryption/decryption.

Vault Guard can be self-hosted by cloning the repo and running the code in the main branch.

This app is made with Django Rest Framework and vanilla JavaScript.
